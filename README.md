[Report](https://github.com/SoumyaO/value-proposition-vfs/blob/main/Report.pdf)

## Executive Summary:
In this consulting report, strategic data analytics techniques were employed to address VFS Global's critical challenges. The analysis began with mapping out the organization's business model through a Value Proposition Canvas, gaining insights into key partners, activities, resources, and customer relationships, customer segments, communication channels, revenue streams. The value proposition i.e. identifying products and services to be positioned around what the customer needs and values was framed. 

From this analysis, three major challenges faced by VFS global emerged: time delays in the visa application process, data security of the applicants, and its poor customer service. Data-driven solutions were proposed for these key challenges.

For processing time optimization, a solution was devised involving predictive analysis to forecast demand at different verification stages, complemented by classification and clustering algorithms to identify factors contributing to slow processing times. To tackle security concerns, it was proposed to monitor key data sources and implement anomaly detection algorithms to flag abnormal behavior, with autoencoders identifying high-risk breaches. For customer service improvement, strategies included deploying AI-powered chatbots with NLP capabilities, leveraging historical data to tailor responses effectively. Additionally, NLP combined with ML techniques was suggested to analyze customer feedback data, identifying pain points and facilitating necessary changes.

To guide VFS Global through the implementation process, a detailed innovation roadmap was provided. This roadmap outlines resource requirements, timeframes for strategic improvements, and enhancements in strategy, personnel, governance, and technology. These data-driven solutions aim to optimize operations, enhance security, and elevate customer satisfaction.
